# SlangNet

.NET bindings for [Slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang), a high-level shader language library. The low-level bindings (`SlangNet.Bindings`) are generated by [ClangSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/ClangSharp), the high-level wrapper (`SlangNet.Pretty`) is hand-written (and not fully complete). 

There are also packages to include the native binaries per platform (`SlangNet.Native.*`)

Unfortunately the actual usage of Slang, especially the reflection is very complex and not even the examples use the API directly, which is why I will not continue this project much further.
